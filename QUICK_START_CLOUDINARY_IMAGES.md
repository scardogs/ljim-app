2. Make sure it's an image file (.jpg, .png, .gif, .webp)
3. Check your internet connection
4. Try again after a few seconds

### Image Shows Broken?

1. Check the URL in the "Manual URL" tab
2. Make sure the URL is accessible

### Using OptimizedImage Component:

```jsx
import OptimizedImage from "../OptimizedImage";

<OptimizedImage

  alt="Christmas Service"
  width={800}
