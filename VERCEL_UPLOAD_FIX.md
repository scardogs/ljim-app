# Fix Vercel 413 Upload Error - Direct Cloudinary Upload 🚀

## 🐛 The Problem

**Error 413: Payload Too Large**

- Vercel Free/Hobby plan has a **4.5MB limit** for serverless functions

## ✅ The Solution

**Upload directly from browser to Cloudinary** - bypassing Vercel's serverless functions entirely!

Benefits:

- ✅ No Vercel limits (upload files up to 100MB+)
- ✅ Faster uploads (direct to Cloudinary)
- ✅ No server processing needed
- ✅ Works on all Vercel plans (Free/Hobby/Pro)

## 🔧 Setup Required (One-Time)

### Step 1: Create Cloudinary Upload Preset

This allows browser uploads without revealing your API secret.

1. **Go to Cloudinary Dashboard:**

   - https://cloudinary.com/console
   - Login with your account

2. **Navigate to Settings:**

   - Click the ⚙️ gear icon (top right)
   - Go to **"Upload"** tab
   - Scroll to **"Upload presets"**

3. **Add Upload Preset:**

   - Click **"Add upload preset"**
   - **Preset name:** `ljim_unsigned`
   - **Signing Mode:** Select **"Unsigned"**
   - **Folder:** Leave empty (we'll set it dynamically)
   - **Upload Controls:**
     - ✅ Enable **"Use filename"**
     - ✅ Enable **"Unique filename"**
   - Click **"Save"**

4. **You're done!** The preset name is: `ljim_unsigned`

## 📁 Files Updated

### 1. **VideoUpload.js** ✅

- Now uploads directly to Cloudinary API
- Bypasses Next.js serverless function
- Works with Vercel's limits

### 2. **vercel.json** ✅ (Created)

- Increased function timeout limits
- Better error handling

---

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Before (Failed on Vercel):

```
Browser → Next.js API Route → Cloudinary
          ↑
    (4.5MB limit - FAILS for videos!)
```

### After (Works on Vercel):

```
Browser → Cloudinary API directly
          ↑
    (No limit - WORKS!)
```

## ✅ What You Need to Do

### IMPORTANT: Create Upload Preset in Cloudinary

**Option 1: Through Dashboard (Recommended)**

1. Go to: https://cloudinary.com/console/settings/upload
2. Scroll to "Upload presets"
3. Click "Add upload preset"
4. Fill in:
   ```
   Preset name: ljim_unsigned
   Signing mode: Unsigned
   Folder: (leave empty)
   ```
5. Click "Save"

**Option 2: Using Cloudinary API** (Advanced)

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/YOUR_CLOUD_NAME/upload_presets \
  -u YOUR_API_KEY:YOUR_API_SECRET \
  -d 'name=ljim_unsigned&unsigned=true&folder='
```

## 🔐 Security Note

**Unsigned uploads are safe because:**

- ✅ Only works with your specific cloud name
- ✅ Upload preset controls what's allowed
- ✅ You can restrict file types, sizes, folders
- ✅ Can enable moderation if needed
- ✅ Admin authentication still required in your app

**To make it more secure:**

1. In Cloudinary preset settings:
   - Set allowed formats: `mp4,webm,mov,gif,jpg,png`
   - Set max file size: `52428800` (50MB)
   - Enable folder restriction
   - Enable moderation queue (optional)

## 🚀 Testing

### Test on Localhost:

1. Upload a video/GIF
2. Should work as before ✅

### Test on Vercel:

1. Push changes to Git
2. Vercel auto-deploys
3. Upload a video/GIF on https://ljim.vercel.app
4. Should now work! ✅ No more 413 error

---

## 📊 File Size Limits

### With Direct Upload:

| Media Type | Old Limit (Via API) | New Limit (Direct) |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Images** | 4.5 MB ❌           | 100 MB+ ✅         |
| **Videos** | 4.5 MB ❌           | 100 MB+ ✅         |
| **GIFs**   | 4.5 MB ❌           | 100 MB+ ✅         |

**All working now!** 🎉

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Still Getting 413 Error?

1. **Check upload preset exists:**

   - Go to Cloudinary dashboard
   - Settings → Upload → Upload presets
   - Verify "ljim_unsigned" exists

2. **Check preset is "Unsigned":**

   - Edit the preset
   - Signing mode should be "Unsigned"
   - Save

3. **Check environment variable:**
   - Vercel → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` exists
   - Redeploy after adding

### Upload Preset Not Found Error?

Error: `Upload preset not found`

**Solution:**

- Create the preset in Cloudinary dashboard
- Name must be exactly: `ljim_unsigned`
- Signing mode must be: `Unsigned`

### Different Error?

- Check browser console for details
- Check Cloudinary dashboard for recent uploads
- Verify your Cloudinary credentials in Vercel
